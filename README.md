## Canmore News Summarizer  

After being away at university for a year and a half, I started feeling a bit disconnected from my hometown of Canmore, Alberta. To stay connected, I built a **Python script** that **webscrapes local news websites**, pulls the top articles, summarizes them, and sends the summaries as **text messages** via Twilio.  

I modeled the project after the **Apple News** updates Apple sends throughout the week, so I could get quick summaries of the news without having to dig through websites.  

This was a super fun project that helped me learn a lot about working with recurring HTML structures, navigating them for web scraping, and building communication features with Twilio.
